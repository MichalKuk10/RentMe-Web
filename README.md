 ### Landing page: 
 
 This is the landing page of our website. We have decided to make it as simple as it is possible. At first, the user should not be confused, where to search for products. A not logged-in user can only search for products, but cannot add a new items or lend item.

### Items list: 

This allows user to search for a products he/she is looking for. From an item list user not only can sees prices or item's pictures, but also their locations. We used Google's map API to put the products on the map.
